# Microcontroller Lib

## Note

This library I write on weekends for my sons. For younger as a basis
for toys, for older as an example of MCU code. And
I'm training myself in writing "hardware" code.

Programming in C for AVR MCU in its relative simplicity reminds me of some
BASIC of 90' =) but at the same time it programming contains a some basic elements of
more complex DCS/SCADA systems.

I think that Atmel AVR8 controllers are very good for learning, given
that for the MCU have very good training shields and a lot peripherals modules.

## This repository contains my adapted, new or rewrited code for

- DS7535R TFT 1.4in screen
- DS3231 real-time clock
- AT24C32 EEPROM
- AVR I2C driver
- FIFO ring buffer
- AVR UART driver
- ...
